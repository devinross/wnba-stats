// Where every number on this site comes from.
//
// scripts/fetch-data.mjs pulls from the stats.wnba.com JSON endpoints, but each
// of those endpoints has a human-readable page on the same site showing the
// same rows with the same filters. This module maps one to the other so every
// section can footnote its own source and you can open the page and check the
// numbers by hand.
//
// The query strings here deliberately mirror the parameter sets in
// fetch-data.mjs (COMMON / TEAM_DASH / PLAYER_DASH / ONOFF / LINEUP_DASH). If
// you change a PerMode or a MeasureType there, change it here too, or the
// footnote will point at a view that doesn't reconcile.
//
// `formula` is filled in only where we compute something stats.wnba.com does
// not publish directly — those are the numbers worth double-checking, because
// the arithmetic is ours, not theirs.
