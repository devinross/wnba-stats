// Data layer (static snapshots, split by season and team)
//
// The app never calls stats.wnba.com. `npm run fetch` (scripts/fetch-data.mjs)
// writes plain JSON files that this module reads:
//
//   data/index.json              { currentSeason, seasons: [{ season, ... }] }
//   data/<season>/league.json    { meta, teams: [{ ..., players }], teamRanks,
//                                  teamProfiles, leagueShotZones,
//                                  positionShotZones, teamZoneWins, stale }
//   data/<season>/teams/<id>.json  { games, roster, onOff, fourFactors,
//                                    playerAdv, lineups, shotZones, upcoming,
//                                    errors, stale }
//   data/<season>/salaries.json  { meta, playTypes, teams, players }
//                                (scripts/build-salaries.mjs, current season only)
//
// One file per season held every team, which meant downloading ~900KB to look
// at one of them. Now a cold load is the index plus one season's league file
// (~16KB) plus the team you asked for (~60KB), and everything fetched is kept
// in memory for the rest of the session, so switching back is instant.
