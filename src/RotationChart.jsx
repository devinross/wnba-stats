// Rotation pattern — when each player is actually on the floor.
//
// Every other chart on this site is a season total. This one is a clock: each
// row is a player, each column one minute of game time, and the shading is how
// often she's on the floor in that minute. Starters read as a dark band that
// breaks around the 6-8 minute mark; bench players read as the inverse. Where
// two rows are exact negatives of each other, you're looking at a substitution
// pair.
//
// The shading divides by the games that player appeared in, not the team's
// games, so someone who missed a month still reads as whatever role she plays
// when available. `gp` is on every row so a thin sample is visible rather than
// implied.
//
// The whole season averages away the thing a rotation actually does, which is
// change — so the same grid can be cut into quarters of the schedule (eleven
// games each, a 44-game season). The row set and its order are fixed by the
// season across every toggle, so switching blocks re-shades the grid instead of
// reshuffling it and only the pattern moves.
//
// Built from stats.wnba.com's `gamerotation` endpoint (one request per game),
// aggregated by scripts/fetch-data.mjs into team.rotation.
