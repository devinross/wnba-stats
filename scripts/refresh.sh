# Nightly WNBA data refresh, run locally on your Mac (residential IP reaches
# stats.wnba.com). Refreshes the CURRENT season only — completed seasons are
# fetched once by `npm run fetch -- --missing` and never change — then pushes,
# which triggers a Vercel redeploy. Invoked by the launchd agent (see HOSTING.md).
